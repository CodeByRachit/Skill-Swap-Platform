## üöÄ Technologies Used

**Backend:**
* **Flask:** A lightweight Python web framework.
* **SQLite3:** A file-based SQL database for data storage.
* **Flask-CORS:** For handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
* **Werkzeug:** For secure password hashing.
* **`os` & `uuid`:** Python standard libraries for file system operations and unique ID generation.

**Frontend:**
* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces (used via CDN for simplicity).
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling (used via CDN).
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** Standard web technologies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the Skill Swap Platform up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x:** Make sure you have Python installed.
* **`pip`:** Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).

### 1. Project Structure

Ensure your project directory is structured as follows:

```

skill\_swap\_platform/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skill\_swap.db (will be created automatically)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/ (will be created automatically, for profile photos)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ html\_templates/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html

````

### 2. Backend Setup (`app.py`)

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd skill_swap_platform
    ```

2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Required Python Packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask Flask-Cors Werkzeug
    ```

5.  **Initialize the Database:**
    * The `app.py` script automatically initializes an SQLite database named `skill_swap.db` and creates necessary tables (users, swap_requests, feedback, platform_messages) on its first run.
    * **IMPORTANT:** If you have an existing `skill_swap.db` from a previous version and encounter issues (especially with profile photos or new features), **delete the `skill_swap.db` file** before running `app.py` again. This ensures a fresh database with the correct schema.
    * A default admin user with username `admin` and password `adminpass` will be created if it doesn't already exist.

6.  **Ensure `uploads` Folder Exists:**
    * The `app.py` script will attempt to create an `uploads` directory. Verify that an empty folder named `uploads` exists in your `skill_swap_platform` directory. This is where uploaded profile pictures will be stored.

### 3. Frontend Setup (`index.html`)

The frontend is a single `index.html` file that uses React and Tailwind CSS via CDN links, so no `npm install` or build step is required.

1.  Place the `index.html` file inside the `html_templates` directory.

### 4. Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    * In your terminal (with the virtual environment activated), run:
        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```
    * You should see output indicating the Flask server is running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Keep this terminal window open.

2.  **Access the Frontend:**
    * Open your web browser and navigate to:
        ```
        [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
        ```
    * **Important for updates/changes:** If you make changes to `index.html` or `app.py`, always perform a **hard refresh** in your browser to ensure the latest frontend code is loaded:
        * **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
        * **macOS:** `Cmd + Shift + R`

## üë®‚Äçüíª Usage

1.  **Sign Up:** Create a new user account. You can specify your name, password, location, skills offered, skills wanted, availability, and whether your profile is public.
2.  **Login:** Use your registered username and password to log in.
3.  **My Profile:**
    * Update your profile details.
    * **Upload a profile picture:** Use the "Upload Photo from Device" option to select an image file. The image will be saved to the `uploads` folder on the server.
    * You can also paste a direct image URL in the "Or Paste Photo URL" field.
    * Change your theme.
4.  **Browse Skills:** Explore public profiles of other users. You can search for users by name or skills.
5.  **Swap Requests:**
    * Click "Request Swap" on another user's card to send a request.
    * Go to the "Swap Requests" tab to view your pending, accepted, and rejected requests.
    * If you receive a request, you can accept or reject it.
6.  **Admin Panel:**
    * Log in as the `admin` user (password: `adminpass`).
    * Access the "Admin" tab in the navigation.
    * Manage users, monitor all swap requests, view feedback, send platform-wide messages, and download reports.

## üìÅ File Structure

* `app.py`: The Flask backend application, handling API routes, database interactions, and serving static files.
* `html_templates/`: Contains the `index.html` file for the frontend.
* `uploads/`: Stores user-uploaded profile pictures.
* `skill_swap.db`: The SQLite database file (created automatically on first run).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

* **"No Photo Upload Option" / Old Frontend:** Perform a **hard refresh** in your browser (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`). Browser caching is a common culprit.
* **"Swap Request Count Always Zero" / Data Issues:**
    * **Delete `skill_swap.db`** and restart `app.py`. This ensures a clean database schema.
    * Check the terminal where `app.py` is running for any error messages or debug prints (e.g., "Fetched X swap requests...").
* **"Network Error" / "Failed to fetch":**
    * Ensure your Flask backend (`app.py`) is running in a terminal.
    * Verify that the `BASE_URL` in `index.html` (`http://127.0.0.1:5000`) matches the address where your Flask app is running.
* **"User not found" / Login Issues:**
    * Make sure you are using the correct username and password.
    * If you deleted `skill_swap.db`, the admin user (`admin`/`adminpass`) will be recreated. Other users will need to sign up again.
* **Uploaded images not appearing:**
    * Check if the `uploads` folder exists in your project directory.
    * Verify that the image files are actually being saved into the `uploads` folder.
    * Ensure the `uploaded_file` route in `app.py` is correctly serving files from the `uploads` directory.

## üí° Future Enhancements

* **User Search Improvements:** More advanced filtering and sorting options.
* **Real-time Notifications:** Use WebSockets for instant notifications on new swap requests or status updates.
* **Messaging System:** Allow users to directly message each other after a swap is accepted.
* **Skill Categories:** Organize skills into categories for easier browsing.
* **User Ratings/Reviews:** Expand the feedback system to include public ratings and reviews on user profiles.
* **More Robust Authentication:** Implement JWTs or OAuth for better security.
* **Deployment:** Prepare the application for deployment to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud).
